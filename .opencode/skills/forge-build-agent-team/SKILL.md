# Skill: Build a Custom Agent Team from a PRD

You are building a team of custom agents and reusable skills from a PRD, Product Vision with Feature documents, or a Feature PRD. The goal is to produce specialist `.md` agent files committed to a repository so the agent harness can act as each team member.

---

## Process

### Step 0: Detect Mode

Load `references/detect-harness.md` to determine `HARNESS_AGENTS_DIR` and `HARNESS_SKILLS_DIR` for this repository. Use these variables wherever agent or skill file paths are referenced below.

| Mode | Signals | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| **Full Build** | Complete PRD with Overview, Technical Architecture, Implementation Phases. No `.md` agent files in `HARNESS_AGENTS_DIR` beyond forge templates. | Continue with Steps 1–8 below. |
| **Vision + Features** | `docs/product-vision.md` exists with feature documents in `docs/features/`. No `.md` agent files beyond forge templates. | Load `references/vision-features-mode.md` and follow its process. |
| **Feature Increment** | Document is a Feature PRD (has "Feature Overview", "Agent Impact Assessment"). Existing `.md` agent files in `HARNESS_AGENTS_DIR`. | Load `references/feature-increment-mode.md` and follow its process. |

### Step 1: Locate and Analyze the PRD

Find the PRD at `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/spec.md`, or `README.md`. Read the entire document and extract:

1. **Technology stack** - languages, frameworks, engines, build tools.
2. **Project structure** - file layout, module boundaries, entry points.
3. **Functional requirement groups** - distinct feature areas.
4. **Non-functional requirements** - performance, security, accessibility.
5. **Implementation phases** - ordered stages of work.
6. **Testing strategy** - frameworks, coverage expectations, test scenarios.
7. **Cross-cutting concerns** - deployment, CI/CD, observability.

### Step 2: Identify Specialist Roles

Map PRD domains to specialist agents. Each agent owns a distinct, non-overlapping area.

**Required agents (always):** Project Architect (scaffolding, build config, dependencies, folder structure), QA / Test Engineer (test framework, unit/integration tests).

**Domain agents** (based on tech stack): Framework Specialist, Backend Engineer, Frontend Engineer, DevOps/Infra Engineer, PWA/Offline Specialist.

**Feature agents** (based on requirement groups): Core Logic Engineer, UI/HUD Developer, VFX/Animation, Audio Engineer, Data/Analytics Engineer, Security Engineer.

**When the PRD names an agent framework** (LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, Semantic Kernel, etc.): create a dedicated `[framework]-specialist` that owns the framework surface (wiring, state schema, tool registry) and pair it with node-level engineers that own individual nodes. This keeps framework upgrades and feature work separate.

**Naming:** lowercase-hyphenated, role-descriptive. `checkout-engineer`, `notifications-specialist`.

### Step 3: Define Agent Boundaries

For each agent: Expertise (4–8 bullets), Key Reference (cited PRD sections), Responsibilities (grouped by component/file, referencing PRD requirement IDs), Constraints, Output Standards, Collaboration.

**Boundary rules:** No two agents own the same file/responsibility. Every PRD requirement maps to exactly one agent. Reference PRD section numbers - don't copy requirement tables. If responsibilities exceed ~15 items, consider splitting.

### Step 4: Identify Reusable Skills

Skills are reusable process templates. Create a skill only when a pattern repeats across the project. One-off tasks belong in agent responsibilities.

**When to create a skill (not an agent responsibility):**
- A pattern repeats across multiple components or features
- The process is complex enough that agents benefit from explicit step-by-step guidance
- The task has non-obvious edge cases or project-specific conventions the agent wouldn't know

**When to put it in `scripts/` instead:** If the logic is deterministic and doesn't need agent judgment (format conversion, validation, scaffolding), write a script and bundle it in the skill's `scripts/` directory. Agents invoke the script rather than reinventing the logic each run.

**Skill scoping:** Don't create overly narrow skills (one per entity type) or overly broad ones (one catch-all). A skill for "create a data model + run migration + update API schema" is a coherent unit. A skill that also covers database administration is too broad.

**Naming:** lowercase-hyphenated, verb-noun: `create-data-model`, `setup-database`.

**Progressive disclosure:** If a skill's template code exceeds ~50 lines, put it in `assets/` and reference it from `SKILL.md`. If a skill has detailed reference material (schemas, API docs, error codes), put it in `references/` with explicit load triggers ("Load `references/api-errors.md` if the API returns a non-200 status").

**Quality from the start (required):** For each new skill, run `skill-creator` using the structured five-step creation workflow: interview → template selection → scaffold → pre-flight check → `skill-review` validation. Do not hand generated skills to agents until `skill-review` passes with every axis ≥2.0.

### Step 5: Write the Agent Files

Create each agent file at `HARNESS_AGENTS_DIR/{agent-name}.md`:

> **Always double-quote `description:`.** The value is prose and routinely
> contains `: ` (colon-space); unquoted, YAML treats that as a nested mapping
> and `forge-execution-adapter compile` (gray-matter) fails the whole build.
> Wrap every description in double quotes, never a bare scalar. Keep it on a
> **single line** — never a YAML block scalar (`>` / `|`) or multi-line value;
> several harnesses' frontmatter readers cannot parse them.

````markdown
---
name: {agent-name}
description: "{One-sentence summary of expertise and when to use this agent. Reference the project name and specific technology domains.}"
---

You are a **{Role Title}** responsible for {one-sentence scope description}.

---

---

## Expertise

- {Technical specialization - 4–8 bullets}
- {Focus on what the agent wouldn't know without this file}

---

## Key Reference

Always consult [{PRD path}]({relative path}) for authoritative project requirements:

- **Section {N} - {Title}**: {What it covers for this agent}

---

## Responsibilities

### {Component/Area} (`{file path}`)

1. {Specific deliverable referencing PRD requirement IDs}
2. {Next deliverable}

---

## Workflow

{Describe the project-specific workflow for this agent - what to do, in what order, and how to validate. Replace generic "understand/implement/verify/commit/report" steps with concrete guidance.}

{For destructive or batch operations, use plan-validate-execute:
1. Create an intermediate plan
2. Validate the plan against a source of truth
3. Execute only after validation passes}

---

## Validation

After completing a deliverable:
- [ ] Run {project-specific linter/validator}
- [ ] Run {build command}
- [ ] Run {test command} for affected tests
- [ ] Check that {project-specific quality gate}

If validation fails, fix and re-run before committing.

---

## Gotchas

- {Project-specific gotcha the agent would get wrong without being told}
- {API inconsistency, naming mismatch, environment quirk}

---

## Constraints

- {Rule referencing PRD requirement IDs}
- Verify current stable APIs for {tech stack} before implementing - search official docs when uncertain
- Commit with descriptive messages referencing the task/requirement
- Follow orchestrator instructions for progress tracking when working in orchestrated execution

---

## Output Standards

- {Where files go}
- {Coding conventions}
- {API patterns}

---

## Collaboration

- **project-orchestrator** - Coordinates your work, provides task context, tracks progress
- **{other-agent}** - {What they provide or need from this agent}

### Step 6: Write the Skill Files

Create each skill file at `HARNESS_SKILLS_DIR/{skill-name}/SKILL.md`.

**Required approach: use `skill-creator`** for each new skill. It guides through a structured interview, selects the correct template (flat or modular), and validates the output with `skill-review` before the skill is finalized. Every generated skill must score ≥2.0 across all six quality axes.

If `skill-creator` or `skill-review` is not available in the environment, stop and report the missing dependency to the user instead of silently skipping this quality gate.

Only after explicit user approval to proceed without these dependencies, scaffold directly using this template:

> **Always double-quote `description:`** for the same reason as agents: an
> unquoted colon-space breaks YAML frontmatter parsing at compile time. Single
> line only — never a YAML block scalar (`>` / `|`) or multi-line value.

````markdown
---
name: {skill-name}
description: "{One-sentence summary of what this skill does and when to use it. Include specific keywords to help the agent recognize relevant tasks.}"
---

# Skill: {Human-Readable Title}

{One-sentence context about what this skill produces. Trim what the agent already knows.}

---

## Process

### Step 1: {First Step Title}

{Instructions - be prescriptive for fragile operations (exact commands, fixed sequences).
Be flexible for tasks where multiple approaches are valid.}

### Step 2: {Second Step Title}

{Include code templates, examples, or scaffolding patterns.}

### Step 3: {Additional Steps}

{As many steps as needed.}

---

## Output Format

{Template for the expected output. Keep short templates inline; move longer ones to `assets/`.
For templates only needed in certain cases, store in `assets/` and reference with a load trigger.}

---

## Validation

After completing the task:
- [ ] Run {validator/check}
- [ ] Verify {specific quality gate}
- [ ] If validation fails: review error, fix issues, re-validate

---

## Gotchas

- {Environment-specific fact that defies reasonable assumptions}
- {Correction to a mistake agents make without being told}
- {When an agent makes a mistake that needs correction, add it here}

---

## Reference

See [{PRD path}]({relative path}) for the full specification:
- **Section {N}** - {What it covers}

For detailed reference material: load `references/{file}.md` when {trigger condition}.
For output templates: load `assets/{template}.md` when generating {specific output type}.
````

**Progressive disclosure for generated skills:**
- If the skill needs detailed schemas, API docs, or error codes → create `references/` and add load triggers
- If the skill has reusable template/output formats → create `assets/` and reference them
- If the skill has deterministic, repeatable logic → create `scripts/` and invoke from SKILL.md
- Keep `SKILL.md` under 500 lines / 5000 tokens - move everything else to subdirectories

### Step 7: Validate the Team

Before finalizing:

- [ ] Every PRD functional requirement maps to exactly one agent
- [ ] Every agent has `## Collaboration` listing agents it depends on
- [ ] No two agents own the same file or responsibility
- [ ] Agent files end with `.md`; `name:` matches the filename (without extension); every `description:` is single-line, double-quoted YAML (never a block scalar)
- [ ] Skill directory names match the skill `name` field; every `description:` is single-line, double-quoted YAML (never a block scalar)
- [ ] **Frontmatter gate passed:** run `node scripts/validate-frontmatter.mjs` (from this skill's directory) and it exits `0` — it flags block scalars (`>`/`|`), multi-line values, unquoted `: ` values, missing `name`/`description`, and unterminated frontmatter across the harness agents and skills
- [ ] All PRD section references are accurate
- [ ] Agent names are lowercase-hyphenated
- [ ] Team covers: foundation/scaffolding, core logic, testing, and all major feature areas
- [ ] Every agent has a `## Gotchas` section populated with project-specific edge cases
- [ ] Every skill has a `## Validation` section with concrete checks
- [ ] Generated skills use progressive disclosure for content exceeding ~50 lines of templates
- [ ] All agent files have been written to `HARNESS_AGENTS_DIR`, not to `.opencode/agents/` unless that is the detected harness directory

After the validation passes, **write `docs/agent-responsibility-matrix.md`** so the
responsibility map is a durable, reviewable artifact (the workflow-engine compile
gate writes the same file; see the execution-adapter's deterministic matrix).
Mirror its structure:

```markdown
# Agent Responsibility Matrix

- **Source layout:** monolithic | features
- **Source:** docs/PRD.md (or docs/product-vision.md + docs/features/*)

## Team Validation
- Unassigned tasks: **N**   (list any)
- Duplicate file owners: **N**   (list any)
- Orphan agents: **N**   (list any)

## Ownership by Agent

### <agent-name>
| Phase | Feature | Task | Outputs |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | - | 1.1 | src/api/routes.ts |

## Phase Execution Order
1. **<phase-id>** — <title> — owned by <agents>
```

Fill the tables from the PRD's implementation phases and each agent's ownership
mapping; this file becomes the source of truth for who owns what.

### Step 8: Present the Team

Summarize with tables: Custom Agents (name/role/sections/phase), Skills (name/purpose/used by), Collaboration Map.

### Step 9: Recommend Model Assignment

Recommend (don't auto-run) `forge-assign-models` so the user can match each agent to an appropriately sized model. Suggest:
- `/forge-assign-models Discover what models are available and cache the inventory.`
- `/forge-assign-models Recommend a per-agent model and write docs/MODEL-PLAN.md.`
- `/forge-assign-models Apply the recommended models to the agent files.`

After Feature Increment Mode runs, suggest Re-tune mode for targeted refresh.

---

## Collaboration

- **forge-build-prd / forge-build-feature-prd** - Produce the PRD this skill consumes.
- **skill-creator** - Use when creating project-specific skills; runs structured interview → scaffold → `skill-review` validation to ensure quality before agents use the skill.
- **skill-review** - Audit generated skills against the six-axis quality rubric; invoke after skill-creator or run standalone to validate quality.
- **forge-assign-models** - Run after team generation for per-agent model assignment.
- **project-orchestrator** - Coordinates agent implementation phases.

---

## Gotchas

- **Agent `name:` must match the filename (without extension).** `my-agent.md` → `name: my-agent`. A mismatch silently breaks agent detection.
- **Unquoted `description:` with `: ` breaks the build.** `description: Owns the Discovery: recursive scanning…` fails YAML parsing in `forge-execution-adapter compile`, which aborts before the manifest is written. Always double-quote `description:` — every generated agent and skill — and run `scripts/validate-frontmatter.mjs` before finalizing (Step 7).
- **Never write `description:` as a YAML block scalar.** `description: >` (folded) or `description: |` (literal) renders as just `>`/`|` in harnesses with simple frontmatter readers (agents/skills look undecorated), and the `validate-frontmatter.mjs` gate rejects them. Always a single-line, double-quoted value.
- **Never generate agents for areas the PRD doesn't cover.** If in doubt, ask the user rather than speculating.
- **Code block templates must escape nested fenced blocks.** If a generated skill's output template contains markdown code blocks, use ` ``` `` ` syntax or indent differently to avoid breaking the parent template.
- **Feature Increment Mode must never regenerate untouched agents.** It's the most common source of regressions. Always diff before writing.
- **Progressive disclosure requires explicit load triggers.** Don't just say "see references/ for details." Say: "Load `references/api-errors.md` if the API returns a non-200 status code." The agent needs to know WHEN to load.

---

## Guidelines

- **Scale to the project.** 3–4 agents for a weekend prototype, 8–12 for a large application.
- **Agents are specialists.** If you can't articulate unique expertise in one sentence, merge.
- **Skills are reusable processes.** Only create if the pattern repeats. One-off tasks → agent responsibilities.
- **Reference, don't duplicate.** Cite PRD section numbers; don't copy requirement tables.
- **Test the mapping.** Every PRD requirement → exactly one owner agent.
- **Add what the agent lacks, omit what it knows.** If the agent would handle a task correctly without the instruction, cut it.
- **Favor procedures over declarations.** Teach *how to approach* a class of problems, not *what to produce* for a specific instance.
- **Calibrate control per section.** Be prescriptive for fragile operations (exact commands, fixed sequences). Give freedom for flexible tasks where multiple approaches work.
- **Encourage currency verification.** Agents should search latest docs when uncertain.
- **If an agent makes a mistake you have to correct, add the correction to its gotchas.**
