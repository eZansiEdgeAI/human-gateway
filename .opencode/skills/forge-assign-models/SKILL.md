description: Discover which LLM models are available to the user (cloud subscription + local Ollama), classify each generated agent's workload, and recommend (and optionally apply) a per-agent model assignment so that lightweight agents do not default to the most expensive model. Use this skill after `forge-build-agent-team` has produced an agent team, or any time the team changes.

# Skill: Assign Models to a Generated Agent Team

You are assigning a per-agent LLM model to each agent in `HARNESS_AGENTS_DIR`. Load `forge-build-agent-team/references/detect-harness.md` to determine `HARNESS_AGENTS_DIR` for this repository before proceeding. The goal is to match each agent's actual workload (reasoning depth, context size, tool-use, latency sensitivity, safety) to a model from the **inventory the user actually has access to** — including local Ollama models - instead of defaulting every agent to the strongest (and most expensive) cloud model.

This skill is **opt-in and post-hoc**. The `model:` field is optional; absence means "use
the user's current default model".

---

## Modes

| Mode | What it does | Writes files? |
|------|--------------|---------------|
| **Discover** | Enumerate available models and cache the inventory. | Only `docs/research/model-inventory.json`. |
| **Recommend** | Produce `docs/MODEL-PLAN.md` with a proposed model per agent + rationale. | Only `docs/MODEL-PLAN.md`. |
| **Apply** | Write `model:` and `modelFallback:` into each agent's YAML frontmatter; refresh `docs/MODEL-PLAN.md`. | Agent files + `docs/MODEL-PLAN.md`. |
| **Re-tune** | Re-run after team changes; only re-evaluate agents whose role changed. | Only changed agent files + `docs/MODEL-PLAN.md`. |

Default to **Recommend** if no mode is specified.

---

## Process

### Step 0: Detect Mode and Preconditions

1. Confirm `HARNESS_AGENTS_DIR` exists and contains agent files beyond the forge templates
   (`project-orchestrator`, `forge-team-builder`). If not, stop and instruct the user to
   run `forge-build-agent-team` first.
2. Determine mode from the user's prompt:
   - "discover" / "what models do I have" → **Discover**
   - "recommend" / "suggest" / no mode → **Recommend**
   - "apply" / "set" / "write" → **Apply** (requires explicit confirmation)
   - "re-tune" / "refresh" / "update after feature" → **Re-tune**
3. If `docs/research/model-inventory.json` exists and is < 7 days old, reuse it.
4. If `docs/MODEL-PLAN.md` exists, treat it as the prior plan; prefer minimal changes.

---

### Step 1: Discover the Available Model Inventory

Build a single inventory of models the user can invoke. Never invent models.

#### 1a. Local Ollama

Default to `http://localhost:11434` (honor `OLLAMA_HOST` if set).
1. `GET /api/tags` - capture `name`, `size`, `modified_at`.
2. `ollama show <name>` or `POST /api/show` - capture `parameter_size`, `context_length`, `quantization_level`, tool/function calling support.
3. **Filter out models without tool calling.** Mark them as `excluded: "no tool calling"`.
4. Cross-reference `docs/research/model-evals/` if present; attach `eval_score` and `eval_notes`. Do not re-benchmark.

If Ollama is unreachable, record `{ "ollama": { "available": false, "reason": "..." } }` and continue.

#### 1b. BYOK Provider

If `COPILOT_PROVIDER_BASE_URL` is set: `GET {base_url}/v1/models`. Capture `id` and `context_length`. On 401/403/404, record the reason and skip.

#### 1c. Copilot Subscription

Copilot subscription models are **not enumerable from a skill**. Present the tier catalog from `references/model-inventory-schema.md` and ask the user to confirm which models their plan shows. Treat as a hint, not truth - the user must verify against their current model picker.

#### 1d. Persist the Inventory

Write `docs/research/model-inventory.json`. Load `references/model-inventory-schema.md` for the canonical JSON shape. Adapt to what was actually discovered; omit empty sections.

If in **Discover** mode, stop here and present a human-readable summary.

---

### Step 2: Read and Classify Each Agent's Workload

For each file matching `HARNESS_AGENTS_DIR/*.md`:
1. Parse YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `model`, `modelFallback`).
2. Read skills referenced in `## Collaboration` / `## Skills` sections - they often reveal the real workload.

Score each agent on this rubric (1 = low, 2 = medium, 3 = high):

| Axis | High (3) signals | Low (1) signals |
|------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Reasoning depth** | Architecture, refactor, security review, debugging, multi-file design | Doc writing, formatting, lint fixes, single-file edits |
| **Code-gen volume** | Generates many files, scaffolds subsystems | Small targeted edits, mostly prose |
| **Context window need** | Reads many files, references full PRD + feature docs | Operates on 1–2 files |
| **Tool-calling reliance** | Heavy file/edit/build/test tool use | Mostly chat/text output |
| **Latency sensitivity** | Interactive pairing, fast feedback loops | Long-running phase work |
| **Determinism / safety** | Security, auth, migrations, payments | Cosmetic changes, drafts |

Map scores to tiers:
- **Tier S (Strong)** - Reasoning depth = 3 OR determinism/safety = 3 OR (context = 3 AND reasoning ≥ 2)
- **Tier M (Balanced)** - Most domain/feature engineers (reasoning 2, code-gen 2–3, context 2, tool-use 3)
- **Tier L (Light)** - Reasoning ≤ 2, code-gen ≤ 2, context = 1

Always record per-axis scores so the recommendation is auditable.

---

### Step 3: Map Tiers to Concrete Models

Pick a **primary** and **fallback** for each agent from the inventory. Rules:
1. **Tool-calling gate.** If tool-calling axis ≥ 2, both primary and fallback must support tool calling.
2. **Context window.** If context axis = 3, prefer largest `context_length`.
3. **Local-first override.** If user requested "local"/"BYOK"/"offline" or `COPILOT_OFFLINE=true`, prefer Ollama even for Tier S.
4. **Default tier mapping:** Tier S → strongest reasoning cloud; Tier M → balanced cloud; Tier L → fast/light cloud. Fallback = strongest local model at each tier.
5. **Stable selection.** Prefer models already in prior `docs/MODEL-PLAN.md`.
6. **Always emit a fallback.** If no second model exists, set `modelFallback: <same as primary>` and note it.

---

### Step 4: Produce `docs/MODEL-PLAN.md`

Write with this structure:

````markdown
# Model Assignment Plan

**Generated by:** `forge-assign-models` skill
**Mode:** {Discover | Recommend | Apply | Re-tune}
**Inventory snapshot:** `docs/research/model-inventory.json` (last verified: YYYY-MM-DD)
**Status:** {Proposed | Applied on YYYY-MM-DD}

> Per-agent model assignment is honored by VS Code custom agents via the `model:` field.
> In Copilot CLI, assignments are advisory - the model is process-wide via `COPILOT_MODEL`.

## Inventory Used

### Local (Ollama)
| Model | Params | Context | Tool calls | Eval score |
|-------|--------|---------|-----------|-----------|

### Copilot subscription
| Model | Tier hint |
|-------|-----------|

## Per-Agent Assignment

| Agent | Tier | Primary model | Fallback model | Rationale |

## Per-Agent Scores

| Agent | Reasoning | Code-gen | Context | Tool use | Latency | Safety | Tier |
|-------|-----------|----------|---------|----------|---------|--------|------|

## Notes

- Tiers and rubric defined in `forge-assign-models` SKILL.md.
- Regenerate via Re-tune mode after team changes.

### Step 5 (Apply mode only): Write `model:` into Agent Frontmatter

For each `HARNESS_AGENTS_DIR/*.md`:
1. Parse YAML frontmatter.
2. Add/update only `model:` and `modelFallback:`. Preserve all other keys and ordering.
3. Do not modify the body. Do not reformat.
4. If `model:` already matches, leave untouched.
5. After writes, regenerate `docs/MODEL-PLAN.md` with `Status: Applied on <date>`.

**Constraints:** Never delete/rename keys. Never touch agents whose tier wouldn't change. Never write un-inventoried models. Always present a diff summary first.

---

### Step 6 (Re-tune mode): Targeted Refresh After Team Changes

1. Read prior `docs/MODEL-PLAN.md` and inventory.
2. Diff `HARNESS_AGENTS_DIR/*.md` against prior plan. New agents → score. Changed agents → re-score, update only if tier changes. Unchanged → leave alone.
3. Refresh inventory only if > 7 days old or user requests.
4. Update `docs/MODEL-PLAN.md` and affected agent files only.

---

## Gotchas

- **`ollama show` failures.** Some models (especially quantized or custom) don't return metadata reliably. If `ollama show` fails, check capability via `ollama run <model> "list your tools"` as a fallback, and mark `tool_calling: "unverified"` in the inventory.
- **Copilot model names change frequently.** The tier catalog in `references/model-inventory-schema.md` is a snapshot. Always ask the user to confirm against their current model picker.
- **Empty inventory is a hard stop.** If no models are discoverable (Ollama unreachable, no subscription confirmation), stop and tell the user. Never fabricate.
- **Don't touch the forge meta-agents.** `project-orchestrator` and `forge-team-builder` are tooling, not domain agents. Skip them unless explicitly asked.
- **Re-tune mirrors the team builder's minimal-change philosophy.** Only modify what changed.

---

## Constraints

- **Privacy:** never transmit inventory or agent contents externally.
- **Capability gating:** no tool-calling-capable model assignments for agents with tool-use axis ≥ 2.
- **No fabricated models.** Only models in `docs/research/model-inventory.json`.
- **No price tables.** Use relative tiers (S/M/L).
- **Determinism.** Same team + same inventory → same plan every run.
- **Backwards compatibility.** `model:` and `modelFallback:` are optional.

---

## Output Standards

- Inventory cache → `docs/research/model-inventory.json`
- Plan document → `docs/MODEL-PLAN.md`
- Per-agent assignment → `model:` and `modelFallback:` in `HARNESS_AGENTS_DIR/*.md` (Apply mode only)
